# Writing

The user experienced greatly depends on clear, concise, and consistent texts. We follow a set of guidelines concerning writing style and terminology to adress this concern.

## Terminology

It is easier for the user to associate a concept with one word and learn it once, so we agree on some key terms and use them consistently across interfaces.


##### Author
_Do not use "user"._

##### Book

Only use 'book' to name the intellectual entity of a book, not its representations. A book is defined by its title, author, and content (source). We avoid using 'book' to talk about outputted forms like e-books or websites of books, where we prefer using non-ambiguous, dedicated terms.

##### Discussion
_Do not use "issue"._

##### Merge Request
_Do not use "pull request"._

##### Update
_Do not use "build"._

# Blankslate

Blankslates are for when there is a lack of content within a page or section. Use them as placeholders to tell users why something isnâ€™t there. Be sure to provide an action to add content as well.

### Basic example

Wrap some content in the outer `.blankslate` wrapper to give it the blankslate appearance.

{% example html %}
<div class="blankslate">
    <div class="icon"><i class="octicon octicon-book"></i></div>
    <h3>This is a blank slate</h3>
    <p>Use it to provide information when no dynamic content exists.</p>
</div>
{% endexample %}
